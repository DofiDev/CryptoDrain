This script utilizes smart contracts to extract crypto tokens from wallets and liquidity pools on DeFi platforms, as well as injected Web3 wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and WalletConnect. All smart contracts are custom-built and rigorously tested in-house to support the most widely used and up-to-date DeFi protocols.

Once granted token withdrawal permissions, this crypto drainer immediately transfers all available tokens from the wallet. The Multichain Crypto Drainer scans the userâ€™s wallet across all supported networks to ensure no assets are missed.

Crypto Drainer scans the user's cryptocurrency wallet for all accessible networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and over 16 additional EVM-compatible chains. It systematically checks each networkâ€™s wallet address for tokens with active PERMIT approvals. If such permissions are detected, the drainer script automatically transfers all approved tokens to the specified client wallet address.
